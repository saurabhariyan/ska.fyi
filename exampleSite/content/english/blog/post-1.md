This is a collection of internet _gyans_  (phrases/wisdoms/truism) that resonate with me! 

- ##### Life moves in one direction!
- ##### Fight Club was wrong. You are your job 
    Anything you spend over a third of your time becomes significant part of your life. 
    People mostly use "not being thier job" as an excuse for being stuck in shitty job. Possible reasons: ( from good to worse ) 
    - interia
    - fear of being rejected in interview
    - imposter syndrom. 
- #### Natural talent is myth.
- #### Ration your `fucks`
    More so for people (like me) who get significanlty affected by politics or things that you can't realistically bring change to. Practising strategic apathy rather than being completely overwhelmed or worse indifferent. 
- #### Comofortable in not having an opinion
